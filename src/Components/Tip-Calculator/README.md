### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me in applying certain flexbox and text aligning styles without defining separate classes.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/) - This helped me in understanding the grid system which helped in creating the responsive mobile design.
